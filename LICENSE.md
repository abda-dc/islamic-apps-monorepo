# Monorepo License Notice

This repository is a monorepo that contains multiple independent projects.  
Licensing is applied **per project**, not as a single license for the entire repository.

## License Boundaries

### Services (Backend APIs)
All projects under `Services/` are licensed under **MIT**, unless a specific service states otherwise.

- Each service contains its own `LICENSE` file that is authoritative.

### Apps (Client Applications)
All projects under `apps/` are licensed under **AGPL-3.0**, unless a specific app states otherwise.

- Each app contains its own `LICENSE` file that is authoritative.

## Rule of Interpretation

If there is any conflict between this notice and a project’s own `LICENSE` file,  
the **project’s `LICENSE` file wins**.

## Summary

- `Services/*` → MIT (check each service `LICENSE`)
- `apps/*` → AGPL-3.0 (check each app `LICENSE`)
